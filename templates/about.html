                <p>Hello everyone! My name is Chi Luan Ma and I am the founder of ManDoBrows, a beauty salon that
                    specializes in Permanent make up and Mini tattoos.
                    I spent most of my youth in a beautiful small country - Vietnam. In 2017, My wife and I moved to
                    Canada to settle down. I tried all kinds of jobs to support my family because my qualifications
                    were not recognized here. Despite all the difficulties and challenges, I discovered my passion
                    for beauty and especially for eyebrows.
                    In early 2022, I started taking online courses on eyebrow tattooing. In January 2023, I decided
                    to return to Vietnam to attend the HT Brows Academy, which is considered one of the best beauty
                    schools in Vietnam, to obtain a professional certification.
                    In April 2023, I was overjoyed to receive my diploma with honors.
                    Now, Iâ€™m confident in using my skills and knowledge to serve my clients. I hope that you can
                    trust me and help me succeed in this career path. In return, I will help you achieve the
                    confidence and beauty that you deserve.
                    Let's give each other the opportunity to grow together!</p>
